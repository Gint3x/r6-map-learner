## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Simple tool to learn room names of maps from the FPS game R6

The base program works similar to seterra where the user selects a map and a floor. Then the program starta a stopwatch and displays a room name that the user should locate and click on. (2D maps)

I have only added floor 1 and 2 for Bank. But might add all maps and their floors if interest arises.
